# Testing-in-python
These questions are provided in the Codio workspace – Testing with Python – where the activities should be completed.

Question 1
Run styleLint.py in Codio.

What happens when the code is run? Can you modify this code for a more favourable outcome? What amendments have you made to the code?

Question 2

pip install pylint
Run

 pylint 
on pylintTest.py

Review each of the code errors returned. Can you correct each of the errors identified by pylint?

Before correcting the code errors, save the pylintTest.py file with a new name (it will be needed again in the next question).

Question 3

pip install flake8
Run

flake8 
on pylintTest.py

Review the errors returned. In what way does this error message differ from the error message returned by pylint?

Run flake8 on metricTest.py. Can you correct each of the errors returned by flake8? What amendments have you made to the code?

Question 4

pip install mccabe
Run
mccabe 
on sums.py. What is the result?

Run

mccabe 
on sums2.py. What is the result?

What are the contributors to the cyclomatic complexity in each piece of code?

Question 5 (e-portfolio entry)
From Section 5 of the Firdaus et al (2014) reading, select a test technique from the following categories:

Specification-based techniques
Structure-based techniques
Experience-based techniques
Discuss the scenario(s) in which each technique would be important to be used.

These will be discussed during this week’s seminar. You will also have the opportunity to discuss your team’s progress during the seminar.
